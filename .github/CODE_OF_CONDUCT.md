# Code of Conduct (EN)

We want working on this project to be enjoyable and safe for everyone.

## Rules
- We respect each other. We critique **code and ideas**, not people.
- Feedback should be specific and helpful (proposal + rationale).
- We avoid personal attacks and offensive language.
- For major decisions, we explain the reasoning; if needed — we vote.

## Resolving issues
If something goes wrong: describe it clearly (context + links + code) and start a discussion. We prioritize what’s best for the project; in case of a dispute — we vote.

Thank you for maintaining a positive collaboration culture.
