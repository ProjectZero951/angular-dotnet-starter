# Contributing (EN)

Thanks for contributing! This repository is a shared project template.

## How to contribute
- For bigger changes (architecture, conventions, patterns), please open an issue first and discuss it with the team.
- Small improvements (typos, refactors, minor enhancements) can go straight as a PR — no separate issue required.

## Pull Requests
- Keep PRs small and focused (one topic).
- Explain **what** and **why** (context matters).
- Link the issue if it exists.
- We require at least two reviews before merging.

## Branching model
- We use **trunk-based development** (not the old, heavy GitFlow).
- `main` should always remain in a releasable state.
- Work on short-lived branches (e.g. `feature/*`, `fix/*`) and merge frequently.

## Coding guidelines (minimum)
- We value readability and consistency — simple beats “clever”.
- Follow existing patterns and naming conventions in the repo.
- If you introduce a new dependency/pattern, justify it in the PR.

## Decision making
- We discuss bigger changes; if there’s no consensus — we vote.
